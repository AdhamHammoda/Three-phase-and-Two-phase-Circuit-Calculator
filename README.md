# Three-phase-and-Two-phase-Circuit-Calculator
In this project, we offer a graphical user interface (GUI) to help electrical machines and power grid designers in analyzing three-phase circuits. Three phase systems are of great importance and used for electric power generation in most parts of the world as they can provide one-phase and two-phase inputs (or any polyphase inputs for that matter) when needed, the instantaneous power generated from a three-phase system is constant and not pulsating and it is found to be more economically efficient than equivalent single phase systems. Using this tool, we have created, one can analyze positive or negative-sequence three-phase systems. In addition, we have empowered the user with the capability to analyze two-phase systems as well.
